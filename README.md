My solutions for some programming challenges from
[Baekjoon Online Judge](https://www.acmicpc.net),
in x86 assembly code (NASM 32-bit).

## Sh&#42;tcode Warning

I mainly focused on making these codes "just work," therefore some of them may
look crappy, or slower than equivalent programs written in other high level
programming languages.
